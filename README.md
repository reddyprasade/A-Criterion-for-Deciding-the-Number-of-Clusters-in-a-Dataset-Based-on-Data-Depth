# A-Criterion-for-Deciding-the-Number-of-Clusters-in-a-Dataset-Based-on-Data-Depth
This paper proposes a novel idea for ¯nding the correct number of groups in a dataset based on data depth. The idea is to avoid the traditional process of running the clustering algorithm over a dataset for ffiffiffi n p times and further, ¯nding the k value for a dataset without setting any speci¯c search range for k parameter. We experiment with di®erent indices, namely CH, KL, Silhouette, Gap, CSP and the proposed method on di®erent real and synthetic datasets to estimate the correct number of groups in a dataset. The experimental results on real and synthetic datasets indicate good performance of the proposed method.
